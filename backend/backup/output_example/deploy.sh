# Instructions for deploying the Flappy Bird app using Docker

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Docker Compose (for local development).

## Steps to Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-flappy-bird-app .
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name flappy-bird-app -p 80:80 my-flappy-bird-app
   ```

## Local Development with Docker Compose
1. To use Docker Compose for local development:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost`.

## CI/CD Pipeline
This project utilizes a CI/CD pipeline. Simply make a commit and push to the main branch, the pipeline will:
- Build the Docker image
- Run the automated tests
- Deploy the application if all tests pass.

## Testing
Tests can be run locally using:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
```

This complete configuration includes:
- A deployment script for running the application in a container.
- A Dockerfile for building the application image.
- A CI/CD pipeline configuration using GitLab CI.
- A docker-compose file for local development.
- Full README instructions for deployment and setup.
