# Design Document for Flappy Bird Punishment Game

## Module: main.py

### Class: Application
This is the main class that encapsulates the game logic and state. It will manage the game loop, user inputs, and the interaction of all game components.

#### Methods:
1. `__init__(self)`:
    - **Description**: Initializes the game state, including setting up the game screen, key variables, and loading assets.
    - **Parameters**: None
    - **Returns**: None

2. `run(self)`:
    - **Description**: Main game loop which keeps the game running, checking for user input, updating game state, and rendering graphics.
    - **Parameters**: None
    - **Returns**: None

3. `handle_input(self)`:
    - **Description**: Captures user input (e.g., key presses) and updates the game state accordingly (e.g., make the bird jump).
    - **Parameters**: None
    - **Returns**: None

4. `update(self)`:
    - **Description**: Updates the positions of game objects and checks for collisions. Applies the punishment logic if the player dies.
    - **Parameters**: None
    - **Returns**: None

5. `render(self)`:
    - **Description**: Draws the game objects on the screen based on their current state (background, bird, pipes, score).
    - **Parameters**: None
    - **Returns**: None

6. `check_collisions(self)`:
    - **Description**: Checks if the bird collides with pipes or the ground.
    - **Parameters**: None
    - **Returns**: `bool` - True if collision detected, otherwise False.

7. `apply_punishment(self)`:
    - **Description**: Logic for punishing the player after they die (e.g., reduce score, delay subsequent game starts).
    - **Parameters**: None
    - **Returns**: None

8. `reset_game(self)`:
    - **Description**: Resets game variables to start a new game.
    - **Parameters**: None
    - **Returns**: None

### Steps for Engineer to Implement the Module:

1. **Set Up Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries (e.g., Pygame for graphics and input handling).

2. **Create the Module**: Create a new file named `main.py`.

3. **Define the Application Class**:
   - Implement the `__init__` method to initialize the game environment.
   - Set up variables for the bird's position, score, and game state.

4. **Implement the Game Loop**:
   - In the `run` method, establish the main game loop that continuously repeats until an exit condition is met.
   - Call the `handle_input`, `update`, and `render` methods within this loop.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - In `handle_input`, capture key inputs to make the bird jump or quit the game.

6. **Game Logic**:
   - Implement the `update` method to move game objects, score points, check for collisions, and apply punishments.

7. **Rendering**:
   - In the `render` method, utilize a graphics library method to draw all game elements on the screen.

8. **Collisions and Punishments**:
   - In `check_collisions`, check for collisions with the pipes or ground.
   - If a collision occurs, call `apply_punishment` and then call `reset_game` to start over.

9. **Testing**: 
   - Create unit tests to ensure game logic functionalities (collisions, score updating, punishments) work as expected.

10. **Documentation**:
    - Comment on each method and class for clarity and future reference.
