### Implementation Steps for Engineer:
1. **Module Setup**:
   - Create a file named `main.py`.
   - Copy the provided class structure and method implementations into the file.

2. **Class Initialization**:
   - Instantiate the `Application` class when the app starts.
   - Set a default step goal of 10,000 steps.

3. **Setting Step Goal**:
   - Implement method to allow users to set their desired daily step goal.
   - Ensure input validation for positive integers.

4. **Logging Steps**:
   - Create a method to log the step counts for the day.
   - Ensure validation for non-negative input.

5. **Progress Check**:
   - Implement logic to check current steps against the goal and return a motivational message based on their progress.

6. **Message Generation**:
   - Use random selections for both roast and celebration messages to keep the interactions fresh and engaging.

7. **Daily Steps Record**:
   - Create a method to save the daily steps to a history that includes the date.
   - Reset total steps at the end of each day.

8. **Step History Retrieval**:
   - Implement functionality to provide access to recorded daily step history.

By following these steps, the module will encapsulate the required functionality to track steps, provide motivational prompts, and maintain historical data in a single, self-contained Python application.
