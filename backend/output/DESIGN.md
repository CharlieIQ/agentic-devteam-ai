### Steps for Implementation:

1. **Set Up Environment**: 
   - Create a new Python environment and install necessary libraries (e.g., Google API for Calendar, NLP libraries for natural language processing).

2. **Module Structure**: 
   - Create a file named `main.py` and implement the structure as described above.

3. **Implement Classes**: 
   - Code the functionality for each class, ensuring to define the methods as outlined.
   - Use external libraries where appropriate for tasks like PDF parsing and Google Calendar integration.

4. **Testing**: 
   - Implement unit tests to verify the behavior of methods, especially for task parsing and integration functionalities.

5. **User Interface**: 
   - Once the backend is stable, either create a simple command-line interface or a basic web front-end to interact with the Application class.

6. **Final Integration and Debugging**: 
   - Link all components together, ensuring data flows correctly through the application and is properly managed.

7. **Documentation**: 
   - Write additional documentation as necessary to help future developers understand and work with the codebase.
