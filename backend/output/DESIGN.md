### Steps for Implementation:
1. **Create the Python file**: Create a file named `main.py` in your project directory.
2. **Define the Application class**: Implement the `Application` class with the specified methods for patient and appointment management.
3. **Define the Patient class**: Implement the `Patient` class to keep track of patient details and their treatment notes.
4. **Define the Appointment class**: Implement the `Appointment` class to manage appointment details, including patient association and treatment notes.
5. **Integrate** the methods of `Application`, `Patient`, and `Appointment` classes ensuring that they interact correctly.
6. **Test the module**: Write unit tests or build a simple UI to interact with the functionality provided by the `Application` class, focusing on adding, editing patients, and managing appointments.
7. **Debug and Refine**: Ensure that the code is well-documented and debug any issues that arise during testing.
