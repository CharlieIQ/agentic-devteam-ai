### Security Audit Report for Student Planner Application

#### 1. Introduction
This report evaluates the backend code of the Student Planner Application to identify potential security vulnerabilities related to input validation, authentication, authorization, and data handling.

#### 2. Identified Vulnerabilities

##### A. Input Validation
- **Vulnerability**: The `add_task` function and `_parse_task_description` method are susceptible to injection attacks because they do not validate or sanitize user input. The use of regular expressions in `_parse_task_description` may lead to unexpected behavior if an attacker provides specially crafted input.
  
##### B. Authentication and Authorization
- **Vulnerability**: There is no indication of authentication or authorization mechanisms in the provided code. Users can perform operations without verifying their identity or permissions, exposing sensitive data and functionality.

##### C. Data Handling
- **Vulnerability**: The application handles tasks and deadlines without any form of data encryption or secure transmission practices. This could lead to unauthorized data access if not handled securely, especially when integrating with external services.

##### D. Error Handling
- **Vulnerability**: The application does not implement proper error handling mechanisms. Uncaught exceptions may expose stack traces or other information that could be useful to an attacker.

##### E. External Dependencies
- **Vulnerability**: The use of libraries such as `PyPDF2` without validating input PDFs may lead to vulnerabilities like Denial of Service (DoS) if the library is exploited. Additionally, any external integrations, such as Google Calendar, should implement secure API interactions.

#### 3. Recommendations for Improvement

##### A. Input Validation
- Implement input validation and sanitization measures. Use a trusted library or framework to assess user inputs, checking for length, type, and content.
- Example code modification: Introduce validation for `task_description` in `add_task`.
  ```python
  def add_task(self, task_description: str):
      if not isinstance(task_description, str) or len(task_description) > 255:
          raise ValueError("Invalid task description")
      task = self._parse_task_description(task_description)
      self.tasks.append(task)
  ```

##### B. Authentication and Authorization
- Incorporate user authentication mechanisms using token-based systems (e.g., JWT) to ensure that users are properly authenticated.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user levels within the application to restrict certain functionalities based on the user's role.

##### C. Data Handling
- Always use HTTPS for data transmission to encrypt sensitive data being sent to and from external services.
- Store user data securely by encrypting sensitive data fields within your storage system.

##### D. Error Handling
- Implement custom error handling procedures to manage exceptions properly and prevent exposing sensitive application internals.
- Ensure that logs do not contain sensitive information and are properly secured.

##### E. Secure External Integrations
- Validate and sanitize inputs received from external services (e.g., files from users, external API responses) to mitigate injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
- Implement rate limiting and authentication when communicating with external systems, especially for APIs.

#### 4. Conclusion
Addressing the identified vulnerabilities with the aforementioned recommendations will significantly improve the security posture of the Student Planner Application. Regular security audits and code reviews should be scheduled to continuously identify and mitigate risks associated with evolving security threats.

By taking these steps, you can protect users' data and ensure secure functionalities within the application.
