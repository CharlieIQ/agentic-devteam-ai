Ensure you place this content in the appropriate files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, and the Bash scripts as per your directory structure). The deployment steps outline how to build the Docker image, run unit tests, and deploy your application to production through Docker. The CI/CD setup will ensure your code is tested and deployed automatically whenever you push changes to your repository.
